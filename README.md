# 🍺 Brew — Spec-Driven AI Development

Stop vibe-coding. Start shipping.

**Brew** is an open-source platform that flips AI development on its head:  
you don’t prompt an LLM to spit out random code — you **write product specs**, and Brew turns them into designs, tasks, and working software.

## Why Brew?

- 🚫 **No more spaghetti AI-generated code** — specs keep your project focused and consistent.
- ⚡ **Faster from idea → product** — describe _what you want_, not just _how to hack it together_.
- 🧭 **Stay aligned** — every line of code, test, and doc traces back to the spec.
- 🤝 **Built for solos & small teams** — less chaos, more clarity, easier to collaborate.

## The Problem with Vibe-Coding

LLMs make it easy to generate lots of code fast — but without structure, you end up with:

- Messy architecture
- Missing tests
- Hard-to-maintain projects

Brew solves this by putting the **spec first**. Your requirements become the single source of truth, and AI does the heavy lifting to build _around_ them.

👉 Write specs. 👉 Brew them into products.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Coming soon — we’re brewing up the first developer preview. Stay tuned! 🍻
